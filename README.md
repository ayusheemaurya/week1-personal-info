# week1-personal-info
Hello, this is my first submission for week 1 of the project. This is a personal information manager, it takes user input. 
The program first asks for the user’s name, the name can only be 3-50 characters long, and the program will not accept empty fields.
The program further asks user for their age, the city they live in, and their hobby. 
At any point if the program encounters an empty field it will terminate and the user will have to restart.
